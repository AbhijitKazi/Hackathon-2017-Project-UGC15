Project code: #UGC15 (To make the system responsive)
I4C Code: 11446
Team Name: AlphaOne

The modules that are included in this project are as follows

The whole system is divided into 3 parts
	1. User
	2. Administrator
	3. Department


~~USER~~
The user has the following functionalities (sub modules)
	1: Query Processing
		a) Any user can search a query in FAQs simply by putting some keywords in the search box of the FAQ page.
		b) If the keyword matches his/her query than his/her need is fulfilled immediately.
		c) If the keyword doesn't matches any of the listed queries, a popup message will be displayed with a link to a query form where the user
			can submit his/her query to the respective departments/Admin.
		d) If the query is sent to a department, through the query form, then only that department can/will answer the query, that will reduce the overload
			of the admin.
	2: Query Status Tracking
		a) An user will get a unique identifier (reference number) so that he/she can track the status of his/her query.
	3: Complaint
		a) Only a registered user can submit a complaint to any department or to the admin par se, where in the department official or the admin can
			give a resolution to the complaint.
